# Neighborhood Swatch

## **Overview**
Neighborhood Swatch is an application designed for home buyers who are looking to relocate to Atlanta, Georgia. Purchasing a home is a huge undertaking and the process can quickly become overwhelming when also relocting to a new city. Neighboorhood Swatch was created to give the user a place to start by matching their income with three suggested neighborhoods where they can start their search. After populating three matches, the user can utilize the resources page to browse homes in these zip codes on Realtor.com or learn more about the home buying process in general.
